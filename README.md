# nOwO
###### The anti OwO bot.

Uhh heres the python file for the bot. It's really simple and easy to use. 
The bot deletes any message containing some variations of OwO and UwU, responds with "Get the hell out of here with your gay OwOs, and kicks the message sender.

<h3>The bot isn't usually online and is just a fun little thing I made</h3>
This means that if you want the bot in your server, host it yourself. If you want one of my actual bots in your server, have Useful Bot: https://github.com/That-Thing/UsefulBot
